1)  Solder the IR as per the image uploaded and make the connection accoding to as shown in the document.

2) Using the arduino IDE, connect the arduino to PC/Laptop using the arduino connector and upload the code to arduino.

3) For creating the goggle use normal IR sensor but it is not safe, in case for usage of prolong time period use, try to use any IR led that operates above 960nm.

4) Create a java project in eclipse with java class as RobotExp and copy paste the code from RobotExp.java.

5) Connect the arduino to computer and run the java code. You still need to add a few things to makke the code work. That you will need to figure out on the way.
